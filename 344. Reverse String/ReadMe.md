# 344.Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Two pointer Solution
```

1. Recursive solution
 -Has O(n) time and space complexity due to the recursion stack

2. Two pointer solution
 -Has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, a constant space solution
